The data for this analysis comes from Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (2024).\n\n\nPrescription drug spending constitutes a significant portion of healthcare costs, particularly within the Medicare Part D program, which provides prescription drug coverage to millions of beneficiaries in the United States. In recent years, rising expenditures on specialty drugs and high-use medications have highlighted the financial burden borne by both the healthcare system and individual beneficiaries.

This means that the y-axis scales are not uniform, and we should avoid making direct horizontal comparisons between drugs. Instead, focus on the trends within each drug.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis analysis highlights the beneficiary cost burden and spending trends for the top 20 high-use drugs in Medicare Part D. In 2022, Strensiq, Myalept, and Vimizim emerged as the drugs with the highest average spending per beneficiary, reflecting their significant cost implications for individual patients. On the other hand, Acthar, Soliris, and Strensiq dominated total spending in 2022, underscoring their broader economic impact on the Medicare program.Spending trends from 2018 to 2022 reveal substantial variability among drugs, with some like Cinryze and Ravicti exhibiting relatively steady costs, while others like Haegarda and Acthar experienced significant fluctuations. These patterns suggest diverse factors influencing drug pricing, such as changes in demand, pricing strategies, or treatment availability.\n\n\n\nFunctions Used\n\ndplyr\nfilter(): To subset the data, such as filtering for “Overall” manufacturers and excluding rows with missing values for spending.\narrange(): To sort the data by descending order of spending.\nslice_head(): To select the top 20 drugs based on spending.\nmutate(): To create new variables such as Year for trend analysis.\nselect(): To subset specific columns for trend analysis.\n\ntidyr\npivot_longer(): To transform spending data from wide to long format for trend visualization.\n\nggplot2\ngeom_bar(): To create bar plots for spending per beneficiary and total spending.\ngeom_col(): As an alternative for bar charts with geom_bar().\ngeom_line(): To create line plots for spending trends over time.\ngeom_text(): To annotate bar plots with spending values.\nfacet_wrap(): To create faceted plots for trends, separating each drug into its own panel.\nlabs(): To add titles, subtitles, captions, and axis labels.\nscale_color_viridis_d(): To assign distinctive colors for trend lines in faceted plots.\nscale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma): To format y-axis values for better readability.\ntheme(): To customize the overall appearance of plots, such as adjusting text sizes, colors, and gridlines."

    "text": "This analysis highlights the beneficiary cost burden and spending trends for the top 20 high-use drugs in Medicare Part D. In 2022, Strensiq, Myalept, and Vimizim emerged as the drugs with the highest average spending per beneficiary, reflecting their significant cost implications for individual patients. On the other hand, Acthar, Soliris, and Strensiq dominated total spending in 2022, underscoring their broader economic impact on the Medicare program.Spending trends from 2018 to 2022 reveal substantial variability among drugs, with some like Cinryze and Ravicti exhibiting relatively steady costs, while others like Haegarda and Acthar experienced significant fluctuations. These patterns suggest diverse factors influencing drug pricing, such as changes in demand, pricing strategies, or treatment availability."
