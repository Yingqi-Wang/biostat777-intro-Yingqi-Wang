# Beneficiary Burden by Top 20 High-Use Drugs and Spending Trends
This analysis investigates the **beneficiary cost burden** associated with Top 20 high-use drugs in Medicare Part D in 2022, as well as spending trends from 2018 to 2022. The data for this analysis comes from Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services [@CMS].

## Background üíä
Prescription drug spending constitutes a significant portion of healthcare costs, particularly within the Medicare Part D program, which provides prescription drug coverage to millions of beneficiaries in the United States. In recent years, rising expenditures on specialty drugs and high-use medications have highlighted the financial burden borne by both the healthcare system and individual beneficiaries. Understanding the cost distribution and trends among these high-use drugs is critical for developing strategies to enhance affordability and sustainability in prescription drug coverage[@1].

:::{.callout-note}
Medicare Part D data includes a series of datasets that provide information on prescription drugs prescribed by individual physicians and other healthcare professionals and paid for under the Medicare Part D Prescription Drug program. These datasets contain information on total number of prescriptions dispensed, and the total drug cost by National Provider Identifier (NPI), prescription drug, and geography[@2].

## Data Wrangling üßπ

To explore trends, I focused on high-use drugs and calculated key metrics:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)

data <- read_csv("MedicarePartD.csv")

filtered_data <- data %>%
  filter(Mftr_Name == "Overall") %>%
  filter(!is.na(Avg_Spnd_Per_Bene_2018) & 
         !is.na(Avg_Spnd_Per_Bene_2019) & 
         !is.na(Avg_Spnd_Per_Bene_2020) & 
         !is.na(Avg_Spnd_Per_Bene_2021) & 
         !is.na(Avg_Spnd_Per_Bene_2022))

top20_drugs <- filtered_data %>%
  arrange(desc(Avg_Spnd_Per_Bene_2022)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 20)

:::{.callout-important}
In the spending trend plots, each drug has its own y-axis range to better visualize its individual changes over time. This means that the y-axis scales are not uniform, and **we should avoid making direct horizontal comparisons between drugs.** Instead, focus on the trends within each drug.

## Summary üìí

This analysis highlights the beneficiary cost burden and spending trends for the top 20 high-use drugs in Medicare Part D. In 2022, Strensiq, Myalept, and Vimizim emerged as the drugs with the highest average spending per beneficiary, reflecting their significant cost implications for individual patients. On the other hand, Acthar, Soliris, and Strensiq dominated total spending in 2022, underscoring their broader economic impact on the Medicare program.Spending trends from 2018 to 2022 reveal substantial variability among drugs, with some like Cinryze and Ravicti exhibiting relatively steady costs, while others like Haegarda and Acthar experienced significant fluctuations. These patterns suggest diverse factors influencing drug pricing, such as changes in demand, pricing strategies, or treatment availability.
